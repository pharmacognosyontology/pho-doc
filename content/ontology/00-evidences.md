Most of the information in PHO is organized around the concept of Evidences as stated in the [Evidence Ontology](https://www.evidenceontology.org/)

We have evidences regarding:
- The activity of *compounds* and *extracts* (in vivo, in vitro, in humans)
- The reported *(ethno)medical* use of compounds, extracts and preparations
- The isolation of compounds
- The structure elucidation of compounds
